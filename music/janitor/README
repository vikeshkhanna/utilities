Janitor renames all files inside a root folder recursively if the file names begin with a number. Developed to rename files like "01. <songname>.mp3" to "<songname>.mp3". 

Usage: 

1. You don't have python interpretor:

Download janitor.zip and run the exe :)

2. You are awesome enough to have the python interpretor:

python janitor.py <root folder>

If root folder is missing, the program will ask you for the location. If the locaiton does not exist, Janitor will use current working directory
