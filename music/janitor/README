Janitor renames all files inside a root folder recursively if the file names begin with a number. Developed to rename files like "01. <songname>.mp3" to "<songname>.mp3". 

Requirements - Python interpreter

Usage: python janitor.py <root folder>
       If root folder is missing, the current working directory is used
