Janitor renames all files inside a root folder recursively if the file names begin with a certain regex. Developed to rename files like "01. <songname>.mp3" to "<songname>.mp3". You can also add custom regex. The default behaviour will take care of leading numbers followed by dashes / dots / underscores. For anything else, add your custom regex. You should check out the screenshots for examples of custom regex.

Usage: 

1. You don't have python interpretor:

Download janitor.zip and run the exe :)

2. You are awesome enough to have the python interpretor:

python janitor.py <root folder>

If root folder is missing, the program will ask you for the location. If the locaiton does not exist, Janitor will use current working directory
